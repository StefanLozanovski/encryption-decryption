# Encryption-Decryption
## Learning outcomes
Gradually get familiar with Java, paying special attention to working with files and the command line.
### Stage 1/6: Encrypted!
Learn to input the data and encrypt it, replacing the letters.

### Stage 2/6: Knowledge is key
Learn to encrypt messages with a numeric key, using the Caesar cypher.

### Stage 3/6: Decrypted!
Encrypting a message is only half of the deal: now learn to decrypt it as well, using a standard Unicode table.

### Stage 4/6: I command you
Practice working with the command line, using it for passing the mode, the key and the string.

### Stage 5/6: X-files
Work with files: learn to store your data in a file.  
[Stage implementation](https://hyperskill.org/projects/46/stages/249/implement)
### Stage 6/6: Choices, choices 
Add the possibility to choose a specific encryption algorithm: Ceasar or Unicode.
